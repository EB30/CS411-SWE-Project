## User Story 2: Home Page with Search/Query for recipes

### Summary:
The user should be able to search for recipes based on a search query and preferences, in order for them to choose which recipe(s) they want to make.

### Happy path:
* The Home Page will greet the user by saying “Welcome -username-,” using their Instacart username.

* Also on the home page, below the greeting there will be a search bar for the user to search for recipe(s) and a submit button to submit the query request.

* It also will have an advanced search option that allows the user to search and filter recipes based on cuisines/location, type of dishes, vegetarian/vegan/pescatarian preferences, etc.

* After entering the search criteria and submitting, the user should see a new page with possible search results.
* After viewing possible search results, a user should be able to click on a recipe and view its ingredients, how
to make it, etc. (see Story 3)

### Exceptions:
If the user submits a search/query request for a recipe that does not exist, we will show a message “0 Matching Results Found” and the option to research.
