## User Story 1: Login/Logout for personalized account synced with Todoist

### Summary:
The user must log in through an Instacart account. The home page will be the search page (see Story 2), which will let users be able to enter their information using their Instacart account.

### Happy Path:
* Login: At the top of every page, there will be a "Login" button if the user is not already logged in. This will redirect the user to login with their Todoist account to connect grocery list capabilities.

* Logout: On the top of every page, there will be a “Logout” button, allowing the user to log out and return to the login page.

### Exceptions:
If the user is not authenticated then the user will be returned to the login page with a message saying that their information was incorrect. The user will be able to enter their login details again.
