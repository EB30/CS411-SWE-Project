## Choosing the Framework 

### Options:
* For Frontend, we had the opportunity to choose React or Angular (Both based on Javascript). 
* Notice that Angular involves components that are modular and coherent, making them highly reusable and contributing to a faster development time and is commonly used in mobile development; Additionally, it is easier maintenance and improvement due to self-contained components.
* React is an immense open-source library with a diversity of tools, helpful for building a rich user interface. 

* For Backend, we considered either Django or Node.js. 
* Consider that Django is a conventional tool for developing applications that use relational databases, external libraries, and require fast processing.
* Conversely, Node.js is conducive for applications that utilize client-side processing, processing many requests, and easily scalable. 

### How we decided:  

* We selected Django for backend over Node.js for now because our web application will use a database to store data about our users and concern queried recipes, ingredients, and pricing info from Spoonacular, Instacart APIs. In addition, Django provides security features which is conducive concerning user's personal Instacart account data. 
* We may use MySQL, which is compatible with Django.
* Moreover, we are more familiar with Python than Javascript, and Django is a Python-based framework compared to Node.js which is JavaScript based. 

* We chose React over Angular because of the former's overall greater efficiency, view library, simple API, and lightweight components. 
Notice that Angular has a steeper learning curve than React and due to short time frame and simplicity of React, we favored React. 
* Additionally, React is more suitable for component based UI, which helps modularize the application, and has greater flexiblility in building blocks. 

* Overall, our team interlaces communication between front-end and back-end to develop a seamless web app.
