## User story 4 Revision: Upload recipe information to To Do List.

### Summary:
From the recipe selection page (story 3) user should be able to visualize the ingredients and recipe information in Todoist

### Happy Path:
* When the user presses a button saying "Add to Shopping List", the user is given the option to remove any of the ingredients from the recipe.
* After the user selects and modifies their recipe(s) if desired (see Story 3), the ingredients will be put in a task on a To Do List app where each ingredient they have ordered is displayed on the To Do List.

### Exceptions:
If the user presses the option to discard their ingredients list or return to the recipe phase, they will be returned to the search page to find a new recipe.
