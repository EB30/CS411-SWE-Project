## User story 4 Revision: Upload recipe information to To Do List.

### Summary:
From the recipe selection page (story 3) user should be able to visualize the ingredients and recipe information in To Do List

### Happy Path:
* After the user selects and modifies their recipe(s) if desired (see Story 3), they will be taken to a To Do List page where each ingredient they have ordered is displayed on the To Do List and Recipe Steps.
* User is given the option to remove any of the ingredients from the To Do List

### Exceptions:
If the user presses the option to discard their ingredients list or return to the recipe phase, they will be returned to the search page to find a new recipe.
