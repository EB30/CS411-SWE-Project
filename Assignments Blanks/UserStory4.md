## User story 4: Order from Instacart materials

### Summary:
From the recipe selection page (story 3) user should be able to purchase their chosen ingredients through instacart

### Happy Path:
* After the user selects and modifies their recipe(s) if desired (see Story 3), they will be taken to a checkout page where each ingredient they have ordered is displayed has been added to their cart
* User is given the option to remove any of the ingredients from their cart
* Search bar for instacart exists to manually add ingredients to their cart if desired
* Checking out occurs through a payment method linked to instacart.

### Exceptions:
If the user presses the option to discard their cart and return to the recipe phase, they will be returned to the search page to find a new recipe.
